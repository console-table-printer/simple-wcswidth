# Code Coverage Workflow
#
# This workflow measures and reports code coverage to ensure comprehensive testing.
# It runs on every push/PR to master branch.
#
# What it does:
# 1. Runs all tests with coverage reporting enabled
# 2. Generates coverage reports showing which code is tested
# 3. Uploads coverage data to Codecov for tracking over time
# 4. Provides coverage badges and reports in pull requests
# 5. Helps identify untested code that needs more test coverage
#
# This ensures the codebase is well-tested and helps maintain code quality.
