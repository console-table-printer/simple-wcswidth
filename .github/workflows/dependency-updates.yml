# 2. Updates them to the latest versions
# 3. Runs tests to ensure nothing breaks after updates
# 4. Creates a pull request with the changes if tests pass
# 5. Includes detailed PR description with what was updated
#
# This helps maintain security and ensures the project uses the latest stable versions.
