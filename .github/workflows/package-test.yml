# Package Test Workflow
#
# This workflow tests that the published package works correctly when installed by users.
# It runs on every push/PR to master branch.
#
# What it does:
# 1. Builds the package using the current code
# 2. Creates a test project in a separate directory
# 3. Installs the built package as if it were published to npm
# 4. Runs tests to ensure the package works correctly when imported
# 5. Verifies that all exports are working as expected
#
# This ensures that users can actually use the package after installation.
